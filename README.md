This is a small header/library implementing coroutines/protothreads/"yieldable functions"
or whatever you want to call it.

Initial idea comest from here:
[coroutines in c](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html)

For more in depth description see implementation or this [blogpost](http://kihlander.net/protothreads-with-a-twist.html)!
